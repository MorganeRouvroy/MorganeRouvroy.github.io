    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        I am a last year French engineering student in applied mathematics and computer science at the Grenoble Institute of Technology - ENSIMAG.

        I'm currently seeking a 6-month internship, starting in February/March 2019, in Software Engineering where I could apply my knowledge and skills.
        I particulary like Machine Learning and 3D graphics and am always on the lookout for new challenges to tackle !

experiences:
    - role: Software Engineering Intern
      time: Jun 2018 - Aug 2018
      company: Arm Ltd., Cambridge - UK

        As a summer intern in Arm's Machine Learning team, I spent 3 months working
        on ArmNN's 18.08 release. This open-source project aims at creating
        a software interface for high-performance Neural Network inference on all Arm hardware.

        My work included completing tasks for the 18.08 release but also the designing,
        prototyping and production of an ONNX parser in C++.

        Full report on this internship can be found [here](/static/img/Internship_report.pdf).
