I am a French engineering student in applied mathematics and computer science, graduating in September 2019.
Some of my favorite topics are 3D Graphics and Machine Learning.


I like always having something to do and trying out new things, and am not afraid of challenges.
Apart from programming, I've been part of several associations, including the Art Society of my school as well as
a solidarity project to build a primary school in Senegal.

In my free time, I also enjoy playing video games, drawing and traveling. I love discovering new cultures and
have lived 3 years in South America when I was younger.
