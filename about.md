I am a French Software Engineer, freshly graduated from the Grenoble Institute of Technology - ENSIMAG.
I've moved recently to London, where I'm currently working in a data-warehouse company, Yellowbrick Data. 
While working with databases right now, I'm interested in many computer science fields including optimization and performances
but also 3D graphics or Machine Learning.

I like always having something to do and trying out new things, and am not afraid of challenges.
Apart from programming, I've been part of several associations, including the Art Society of my school as well as
a solidarity project to build a primary school in Senegal.

In my free time, I also enjoy playing video games, drawing and traveling. I love discovering new cultures and
have lived 3 years in South America when I was younger.
