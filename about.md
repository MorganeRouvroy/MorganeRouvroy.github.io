I am a French engineering student in applied mathematics and computer science, entering my last year of studies.
Some of my favourite courses are 3D graphics, Machine Learning and computer vision.


I like always having something to do and trying out new things, and am not afraid of challenges.
Apart from programming, I've been part of several associations, including the Art Society of my school but also
a solidarity project to build a primary school in Senegal.

In my free time, I also enjoy playing video games, drawing and travelling. I love discovering new cultures and
have lived 3 years in South America when I was younger.
