<h1>Multi-agent simulation : cellular automaton and boids (Java)</h1>

<hr />

This project was part of the **Object-Oriented Programming** course.
The aim was to develop in Java an application for graphically simulating multi-agent systems.\\
Simulated systems included three systems of the cellular automaton type:   
* _Conway's game of life_
* _Immigration game_
* _Schelling's segregation model_

Another simulated system was a self-organized swarm movement system: the _Boids_ model.

I was responsible for:
* Global class structuring of the project
* Event manager : update rate, boid death's...
* Schelling's segregation model implementation
* Wolf boid AI

## Cellular automatons

Each cellular automaton implemented follows specific update rules but  share the remaining implementation thanks to inheritance.

## Boids

The Boids model is a flocking simulation model. Each agent is subject to at least two constraints :
* _Neighboor effect_ : depending on their proximity, neighboors of the same specie attract or repel (if too close) each other.
* _Screen encasing_ : borders of the screen repel the boids so as they stay visible during the simulation.

Specific species of boids were created, with customized behaviours :
* _Wolves_ (in red) : wolves tend to hunt together, are pretty fast, are attracted to sheeps and afraid of herdsmen.
* _Sheeps_ (in blue) : sheeps like to stay in big herds and regroup behind herdsmen. They are afraid of wolves but slower than them.
* _Herdsmen_ (in green) : herdsmen try to protect sheeps from wolves. They can kill nearby wolves but are much slower than the other boids.
